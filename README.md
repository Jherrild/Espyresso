# Espyresso
PID and display control software for a Pyboard v1.0 wired into a Coffee Gaggia espresso machine. Includes all necessary supporting libraries.

## Hardware
This setup is designed to drive a SSD1306 OLED display, and interface with two SSRs (solid state relays). The pyboard effectively replaces all of the analog controls of the Coffee Gaggia (Older model of the Gaggia Classic).

## State
This repo is a work in progress. The project is currently not complete, and I will continue to update it over time.
